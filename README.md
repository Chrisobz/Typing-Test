<h1>Typing Speed Test</h1>
A simple typing speed test game designed to help improve typing speed and accuracy, specifically tailored for software development and email communication scenarios.

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is a personal learning tool that I created to help me practice typing faster and more accurately. The sentences used in the test are phrases and snippets that I’m most likely to type in a software developer role, as well as common email templates I might send. This helps me practice in a realistic context and visualize being in a professional environment.

<h2>Features</h2>
<li>Realistic Sentences: The test uses sentences that simulate the type of content a software developer or professional might regularly type.</li>
<li>Accuracy Calculation: The game measures the accuracy of your typing, showing you how closely your input matches the target text.</li>
<li>Words Per Minute (WPM) Calculation: It calculates your typing speed in words per minute, helping you track your improvement over time.</li>
<li>Reset Option: Easily restart the test to practice again and again.</li>


<h2>How to Run</h2>

Install the required dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Install the Pygame library using pip:

<li>pip install pygame</li>

Run the game:
Execute the game script
<li>python your_game_file.py</li>

<h2>Why I Created This</h2>
As a software developer, typing speed and accuracy are crucial for productivity. By practicing with realistic sentences that I encounter in my daily work, I can improve my efficiency and better prepare myself for professional tasks. This tool helps me simulate the typing environment I’ll face and refine my skills accordingly.

Future Improvements
Add a feature to track progress over time.
Implement different difficulty levels with varying sentence lengths and complexities.
Expand the sentence database with more diverse content.
